This is new repository!! good luck
configure local machine to remote machine and clone/pull
pull this readme file to local repository 
make some changes to readme file and commit them and push to central repository
Create branches in local machine and add files and commit changes.
create branches on remote machine 
finally push them to remote branches
last and finall step is to merge the branches (i.e., tansfer files from branch to master)


First Commit

You have done second commit and added files to remote repository and final step will merging

But add/commit this changes to master branch.

Finally you can see the changes and a new branch in Local repository.


Finally once you done pushing file to branch1 in remote repository merge the Test.txt to master branch to master.
